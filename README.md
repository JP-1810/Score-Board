# 🏀 Basketball Scoreboard App

## This is a simple and interactive web app that functions as a basketball-style scoreboard. It features two sections — Home and Away — each with buttons to add 1, 2, or 3 points. 
The score updates in real time with each click, simulating how a scoreboard would work during a game.

## The layout is clean and responsive, designed to mimic the feel of a real digital scoreboard. It’s a great tool for practicing DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is deployed using Netlify. It was originally part of a mini project from the Scrimba Frontend Developer Path, and I customized it as part of my learning experience.
